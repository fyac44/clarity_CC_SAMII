# The Clarity Challenges


:bangbang:
This repository is based on the former clarity challenge repository, but it has been replaced with a newer release of the Clarity code that supports all Clarity Challenges: CEC1, CPC1 and the current challenge CEC2. Please redirect to [https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity).

SAMII is not moving to the newest repository since it was developed here. A newer version of SAMII will be developed in his own repository and will be announce in the future.

This branch is meant to reproduce the results obtained in the challenge.
